                The Ancient Spanish Monastery is a historical site in North Miami, Florida. 
                The monastery was moved from Spain to South Florida, and today it stands as a 
                museum hosting historical artifacts, a beautiful garden, and a charming church. 
                The museumâ€™s website provides information for visitors, photographers, and people 
                interested in renting the space for an event.
